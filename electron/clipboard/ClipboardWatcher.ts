  /**
   * Resync the watcher's last-seen signature to the current clipboard state.

   * Call this after deleting or clearing items. The goal is dual:
   *
   * 1. Prevent "zombie" re-appearances: if the deleted content is still on the
   *    system clipboard, the watcher must NOT re-add it on the next poll. By
   *    re-seeding lastSig from the live clipboard, the next tick sees no change
   *    and stays quiet.
   *
   * 2. Allow re-capture after genuine re-copy: when the user later copies
   *    something different and then copies the original content again, the
   *    clipboard WILL change (different → original), so the watcher will detect
   *    the change and re-capture it correctly.
   *
   * NOTE: The one edge case this does NOT solve is: user copies X, deletes X
   * from Edge-Drop, then immediately copies X again WITHOUT copying anything
   * else in between (system clipboard never changed). In that narrow case we
   * cannot detect the re-copy because the OS clipboard didn't change. This is
   * an acceptable limitation — the common-case fix (zombie prevention) is far
   * more important.
